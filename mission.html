                <p>College campuses thrive with young adults starting and finding their new lives, excitement with student activities, study abroad trips, and keeping up with academics. Lurking in the shadows are the struggles that students face with their mental health. Anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues burden university students as they try to matriculate through college. Many college campuses have mental health services but may not do a good job at creating awareness. It’s one thing to struggle with mental health in college but in the African American community struggling with mental health in general is a challenge. </p>
                <p>Mental health isn’t something that is talked about or recognized in the black community, so imagine going to an historically black college(HBCU) and face these same issues. HBCU students are suffering in their pain because they feel uncomfortable about getting the help that they need because they were taught to be strong and keep pushing through the challenge. I recognized the need for a solution to this problem due to seeing more of my friends cry for help. Soul Glow is a web application that creates mental health awareness and help releive the stress and pressures amongst young black college students.

                <h3>Research Findings</h3>
                <p> I surveyed 92 students across various HBCU’s on how they felt mental health is dealt with in their communities and school. The universities represented in this survey are Howard University, Hampton University, Spelman College, Alabama A&M, Tennessee State, Wilberforce University, Tuskegee University, Southern University A&M College, Clark Atlanta University, Delaware State University, and Florida A&M University.
